During the culmination of my Bachelor's in Software Engineering, I engaged in a transformative endeavor, my Final Year Project (FYP), which exemplifies the intersection of 
technology and societal impact. Collaborating with a school, my team and I conceptualized and brought to fruition an innovative mobile application titled the "Speech Rectification 
Application." This comprehensive solution aimed to address Speech Articulation Disorder (SAD) in children, orchestrating a harmonious integration of frontend technologies such as 
XML and Kotlin, complemented by the robust capabilities of Firebase on the backend.

My pivotal role in the project encompassed the meticulous design of key frontend application screens, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience. Concurrently, I delved into 
the backend development using Kotlin, orchestrating the intricate interplay of functionalities.
A notable facet of our solution involved the utilization of Python for backend development, where we harnessed Machine Learning techniques to train the BERT Masking Model.
This advanced model played a crucial role in rectifying speech articulation issues among children, contributing to a significant 20% improvement as validated through a case 
study involving 30 patients. This collaborative effort with therapists in Pakistan underscored the real-world impact and efficacy of our application.

Beyond design and development, my active involvement extended to conducting interviews with children, essential for gathering valuable insights to enrich our dataset. 
Additionally, a substantial portion of my contributions focused on the comprehensive training of the BERT Machine Learning model, leveraging the capabilities of Google Colab 
for seamless execution. This multifaceted endeavor not only showcased the technical prowess of our team but also demonstrated a deep commitment to leveraging technology for the
betterment of individuals facing communication challenges.
