# Speach Rectification Application
During the culmination of my Bachelor's in Software Engineering, I engaged in a transformative endeavor, my Final Year Project (FYP), which exemplifies the intersection of technology and societal impact. Collaborating with a school, my team and I conceptualized and brought to fruition an innovative mobile application titled the "Speech Rectification Application." This comprehensive solution aimed to address Speech Articulation Disorder (SAD) in children, orchestrating a harmonious integration of frontend technologies such as XML and Kotlin, complemented by the robust capabilities of Firebase on the backend.

## Project Highlights
### Frontend Design
My pivotal role in the project involved meticulously designing key frontend application screens, ensuring a seamless and user-friendly experience for children using the application.

## Backend Development
I delved into backend development using Kotlin, orchestrating the intricate interplay of functionalities. Python was employed for backend development, where we harnessed Machine Learning techniques to train the BERT Masking Model.

## Machine Learning Impact
The BERT Masking Model played a crucial role in rectifying speech articulation issues among children. A case study involving 30 patients revealed a significant 20% improvement, validating the real-world impact and efficacy of our application. Beyond design and development, my active involvement extended to conducting interviews with children, providing valuable insights to enrich our dataset.
